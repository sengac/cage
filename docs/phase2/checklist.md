- ✅ Fixed theme system integration

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Implement VirtualList component** - Core scrolling functionality needed by multiple components
2. **Build EventInspector component** - Primary feature for Phase 2
3. **Create EventDetail viewer** - Essential for event inspection
4. **Implement StreamView** - Real-time monitoring capability
5. **Add File Viewer with syntax highlighting** - Critical for viewing code changes
6. **Build Diff Viewer** - Needed for Edit events
7. **Complete remaining components** - ServerManager, HooksConfig, etc.
8. **Write comprehensive tests** - Ensure reliability
9. **Update documentation** - Complete user and developer guides
10. **Final integration and testing** - Cross-platform validation

## Notes

- Using Ink v6 with React 19 (latest versions)
- Theme system supports dark/light/high-contrast modes
- State management with Zustand for better performance
- All keyboard navigation uses Ink's useInput hook
- Virtual scrolling custom implementation due to Ink limitations
