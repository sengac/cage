# Phase 1 Implementation Overview

## Purpose

This guide provides instructions for implementing Phase 1 of the Cage project using test-driven development. Phase 1 establishes the core hook infrastructure for capturing and persisting Claude Code events.

## Document Structure

The Phase 1 implementation has been split into focused documents:

1. **[overview.md](overview.md)** - This document
2. **[setup.md](setup.md)** - Project setup and prerequisites
3. **[shared-package.md](shared-package.md)** - Shared types and utilities
4. **[cli-package.md](cli-package.md)** - CLI implementation with Ink
5. **[backend-package.md](backend-package.md)** - NestJS backend
6. **[hooks-integration.md](hooks-integration.md)** - Claude Code hook configuration
7. **[testing.md](testing.md)** - Integration testing guide
8. **[checklist.md](checklist.md)** - Implementation checklist and success factors

## Development Methodology: Acceptance Criteria Driven Development (ACDD)

### The Process You MUST Follow:

1. **Read acceptance criteria** from [PHASE1.md](../../PHASE1.md)
2. **Write failing tests** that map exactly to Given-When-Then scenarios
3. **Run tests** to ensure they fail for the right reasons
4. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass
5. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
6. **Document** as features are completed

### Critical Rules:

- **NO production code without failing tests**
- **Every scenario in PHASE1.md gets a test**
- **Use exact Given-When-Then language**
- **All tests must pass before next feature**

## Current Project State Assessment

### Existing Structure

The project already has a monorepo structure in place:

- **Root**: npm workspaces configured with packages/\*
- **Packages**: cli, backend, frontend, shared, hooks directories exist
- **Dependencies**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript tooling installed
- **Scripts**: Basic npm scripts for test, build, dev commands
- **Quality Enforcement**: Git pre-commit hook enforces test-first development

### What Needs to Be Built

Starting from this existing structure, Phase 1 requires implementing the core hook infrastructure with proper test-driven development.

## Implementation Order

1. **Prerequisites** - Complete project setup (see [setup.md](setup.md))
2. **Shared Package** - Types and utilities (see [shared-package.md](shared-package.md))
3. **CLI Core** - Initialize and configure hooks (see [cli-package.md](cli-package.md))
4. **Backend Core** - Event processing and storage (see [backend-package.md](backend-package.md))
5. **Hook Integration** - Connect to Claude Code (see [hooks-integration.md](hooks-integration.md))
6. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end validation (see [testing.md](testing.md))

## Remember

**Test First → Code Second → Refactor Third**

Every acceptance criterion in PHASE1.md must have a corresponding test before any implementation code is written. The tests ARE the specification.
