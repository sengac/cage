## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Claude Code Hook Verification ✅

**MUST verify before implementation:**

- [x] How Claude Code actually executes hooks (JSON via settings.json)
- [x] What data format it expects (JSON via stdin)
- [x] How to handle responses (exit codes and stdout)
- [x] Directory locations for different platforms

### 2. Performance Targets

**Realistic benchmarks:**

- [ ] Non-blocking operations: <100ms response time
- [ ] File writes: Buffered with async flush
- [ ] Event queries: Indexed by date for fast lookup
- [ ] High-frequency events: Queue with batch processing
- [ ] 1000+ events per minute without degradation

### 3. Error Recovery Strategy

**Graceful degradation:**

- [ ] Backend offline: Log to local file, don't block
- [ ] Disk full: Return warning, stop logging, continue
- [ ] Corrupt files: Skip and log error, continue
- [ ] Process crashes: Clean startup recovery
- [ ] Network errors: Timeout and fail gracefully

### 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Platform-specific handling:**

- [ ] Use Node.js path.join() everywhere
- [ ] Handle both forward and backslashes
- [ ] Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] Platform-specific installation docs
- [ ] Handle different shell environments

## Verification Steps

### After Each Component

1. **Run Tests**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Check TypeScript**

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

3. **Check Linting**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Check Coverage**
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

### Before Integration

1. **Build All Packages**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run Quality Checks**

   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```

3. **Manual Smoke Test**
   - Initialize project
   - Start server
   - Configure hooks
   - Trigger sample event
   - Query events

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ **Don't assume Claude Code hook behavior** - Test it first
2. ❌ **Don't use synchronous file operations** - Use async/streaming
3. ❌ **Don't ignore Windows** - Test early and often
4. ❌ **Don't skip error handling** - Every operation can fail
5. ❌ **Don't hardcode paths** - Use configuration
6. ❌ **Don't block Claude** - Always return quickly or async
7. ❌ **Don't write code without tests** - Test first, always
8. ❌ **Don't use `any` type** - Proper TypeScript types only
9. ❌ **Don't exceed 300 lines per file** - Refactor when needed
10. ❌ **Don't use console.log** - Use Logger class

## Questions Resolved

### ✅ Claude Code Hooks

**Q:** How does Claude Code actually call hooks?
**A:** Via shell commands defined in JSON configuration, receiving JSON via stdin

### ✅ Performance

**Q:** Can we achieve <100ms with file I/O?
**A:** Yes, using async operations and buffering

### ✅ Concurrency

**Q:** How to handle multiple Claude instances?
**A:** Session IDs separate events, file locking for writes

### ✅ Storage

**Q:** How to efficiently query large event files?
**A:** Date-based directory structure, streaming JSON parsing

### ✅ Security

**Q:** Do we need authentication for local API?
**A:** No, for single-developer use on localhost only

## Definition of Done

Phase 1 is complete when:

1. ✅ All acceptance criteria from PHASE1.md pass automated tests
2. ✅ Documentation exists for CLI commands and API endpoints
3. ✅ Error scenarios are handled gracefully
4. ✅ Cross-platform compatibility is verified (Windows, macOS, Linux)
5. ✅ Performance benchmarks meet requirements (<100ms, 1000 events/min)
6. ✅ Code passes all quality checks (no TypeScript `any`, proper error handling)
7. ✅ Integration tests verify end-to-end hook flow for all 10 hooks
8. ✅ 80%+ test coverage achieved
9. ✅ Manual testing checklist completed
10. ✅ Installation guide tested by someone else

## Success Metrics

Phase 1 is successful when:

- **100% of Claude Code hook events are captured** (all 10 types)
- **Setup takes less than 2 minutes** (init + hooks setup)
- **No manual configuration files need editing** (automated setup)
- **Developers can see what Claude is doing in real-time** (event streaming)
- **Historical events can be queried for debugging** (date range queries)
- **Zero event loss during normal operation** (reliable logging)
- **Graceful degradation when backend is unavailable** (offline logging)

## Remember

> **Test First → Code Second → Refactor Third**

Every acceptance criterion in PHASE1.md must have a corresponding test before any implementation code is written. The tests ARE the specification.
