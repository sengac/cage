# Phase 1 Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for implementing Phase 1 of the Cage project using test-driven development. Phase 1 establishes the core hook infrastructure for capturing and persisting all 10 Claude Code hook events.

## Document Structure

The Phase 1 implementation has been organized into focused, manageable documents (each under 300 lines):

### Core Documents

1. **[docs/phase1/overview.md](docs/phase1/overview.md)** - Implementation overview and methodology
2. **[docs/phase1/setup.md](docs/phase1/setup.md)** - Project setup and prerequisites
3. **[docs/phase1/shared-package.md](docs/phase1/shared-package.md)** - Shared types and utilities implementation
4. **[docs/phase1/cli-package.md](docs/phase1/cli-package.md)** - CLI implementation with Ink React
5. **[docs/phase1/backend-package.md](docs/phase1/backend-package.md)** - NestJS backend for all 10 hooks
6. **[docs/phase1/hooks-integration.md](docs/phase1/hooks-integration.md)** - Claude Code hook configuration and handler
7. **[docs/phase1/testing.md](docs/phase1/testing.md)** - Integration testing guide
8. **[docs/phase1/checklist.md](docs/phase1/checklist.md)** - Implementation checklist and success factors

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Review Requirements

Read [PHASE1.md](PHASE1.md) for complete acceptance criteria covering all scenarios.

### Step 2: Setup Project

Follow [docs/phase1/setup.md](docs/phase1/setup.md) to configure the development environment.

### Step 3: Implement Components

Implement each component in order, following test-driven development:

1. **Shared Package** - Types and schemas for all 10 hooks
2. **CLI Package** - Commands for initialization and event monitoring
3. **Backend Package** - Event processing for all hook types
4. **Hooks Integration** - Connect Claude Code to Cage

### Step 4: Run Integration Tests

Use [docs/phase1/testing.md](docs/phase1/testing.md) to verify the complete system.

### Step 5: Verify Completion

Check off items in [docs/phase1/checklist.md](docs/phase1/checklist.md).

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

All acceptance criteria from [PHASE1.md](PHASE1.md) are fully covered:

### CLI Installation and Setup ✅

- Install Cage globally
- Initialize Cage in a project
- Configure Claude Code hooks (all 10 types)
- Verify hook configuration

### Backend Event Processing ✅

- Start the backend server
- Receive PreToolUse hook event
- Receive PostToolUse hook event
- Receive UserPromptSubmit hook event
- Receive Notification hook event
- Receive Stop hook event
- Receive SubagentStop hook event
- Receive SessionStart hook event
- Receive SessionEnd hook event
- Receive PreCompact hook event
- Receive Status hook event
- Handle hook when server is down

### File-Based Event Logging ✅

- Log event with complete data
- Rotate log files daily
- Handle high-frequency events
- Query events by date range

### CLI Event Monitoring ✅

- Stream events in real-time
- Filter streamed events by type
- Display event statistics
- Tail recent events
- Tail with custom count

### Error Handling and Recovery ✅

- Handle malformed hook data
- Recover from disk space issues
- Handle concurrent hook triggers

## Development Methodology

### Acceptance Criteria Driven Development (ACDD)

The implementation follows strict test-first development:

1. **Read acceptance criteria** from PHASE1.md
2. **Write failing tests** that map to Given-When-Then scenarios
3. **Run tests** to ensure they fail for the right reasons
4. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass
5. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
6. **Document** as features are completed

### Critical Rules

- **NO production code without failing tests**
- **Every scenario in PHASE1.md gets a test**
- **Use exact Given-When-Then language**
- **All tests must pass before next feature**
- **No TypeScript `any` types**
- **Files must stay under 300 lines**

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation & CLI

- Project setup and configuration
- Shared package with all hook types
- CLI commands implementation

### Week 2: Backend & Event Processing

- NestJS backend with all 10 endpoints
- File-based event logging
- Event query and streaming

### Week 3: Integration & Testing

- Hook handler implementation
- Claude Code configuration
- End-to-end integration testing

### Week 4: Documentation & Polish

- API documentation
- Installation guides
- Cross-platform testing

## Success Metrics

Phase 1 is successful when:

- ✅ 100% of Claude Code hook events are captured (all 10 types)
- ✅ Setup takes less than 2 minutes
- ✅ No manual configuration files need editing
- ✅ Developers can see what Claude is doing in real-time
- ✅ Historical events can be queried for debugging
- ✅ Response time <100ms for non-blocking hooks
- ✅ System handles 1000+ events per minute

## Getting Help

- Review [FOUNDATION.md](FOUNDATION.md) for project goals and context
- Check [docs/phase1/checklist.md](docs/phase1/checklist.md) for common pitfalls
- Refer to acceptance criteria in [PHASE1.md](PHASE1.md) for requirements

## Remember

> **Test First → Code Second → Refactor Third**

Every acceptance criterion must have a corresponding test before implementation.
